# Guess6

This is a simple React/Typescript playground to study basic React features. The app itself is a game which allows the user to guess a 6-letter word from a dictionary. 

# Compilation

To recompile the application, just invoke `webpack` in the root folder

```
webpack
```

# Running the application

To run the application, use any HTTP server capable of serving static files. The [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) would do. So, just install the live-server

```
npm install -g live-server
```

and then run it from the root folder

```
live-server
```

This will host the app under `http://127.0.0.1:8080/app.html`
